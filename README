Simple Queueing Application
Written in Node.js

This application shows how powerful yet easy to create asynchronous applications in node.js.
Web sockets are used for the remote notification across multiple instances of the queueing application.

Node.js module dependencies:
- Redis
- Url
- node-static

This application uses Redis as the in-memory persistence.
